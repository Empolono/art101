						Creating a Digital Art Piece
						I. Set Up the Workspace
							A. Open a digital drawing application
							B. Create a new canvas
								1. Choose canvas dimensions
								2. Set resolution
							C. Set the background color or leave it transparent
						II. Choose and Plan the Subject
							A. Decide on a subject (e.g., character, scene, abstract design)
							B. Gather reference images
								1. Search for relevant images online or take your own
								2. Import references into your workspace or keep them nearby
						III. Sketch the Concept
							A. Select a sketching brush
							B. Draw a rough outline of the subject
							C. Make adjustments to proportions and layout
						IV. Refine Line Art
							A. Create a new layer above the sketch
							B. Select an inking brush (cleaner lines)
							C. Trace over the sketch carefully
							D. Hide or delete the sketch layer once done
						V. Add Base Colors
							A. Create a new layer below the line art
							B. Choose a color palette
							C. Use the fill tool or brushes to color each area of the drawing
						VI. Add Depth with Shading and Highlights
							A. Create separate layers for shadows and highlights
							B. Choose appropriate colors and blend modes (e.g., multiply for shadows)
							C. Add shading to areas based on light direction
							D. Add highlights to surfaces that catch the most light
						VII. Add Background and Final Details
							A. Design a detailed or straightforward background, depending on your style
							B. Add any additional effects or textures
							C. Sign your artwork
						VIII. Save and Export the Artwork
							A. Save the project file (to preserve layers)
							B. Export the final piece as a .PNG or .JPG for sharing or printing
